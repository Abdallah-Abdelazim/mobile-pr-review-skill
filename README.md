# mobile-pr-review

An [agent skill](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) for expert Android, iOS & Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) pull request review. By default it saves every finding as a **PENDING (draft) GitHub review** — invisible until you manually submit it — but you can ask it to post live instead, either up front or when it asks you.

Reviews Kotlin/Jetpack Compose/Gradle, Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit, and KMP code — including shared **Compose Multiplatform** UI — against up-to-date (2026) platform deprecations, Swift 6 / Compose best practices, code smells, and software-engineering excellence standards.

## What's inside

- **1 skill** — `review-mobile-pr`, the orchestrator. Invoke it with a PR URL or number and it runs the whole review end to end.
- **6 built-in review passes**, defined inline in the skill and dispatched in parallel, each a self-contained specialist:

  | Pass | Focus |
  |---|---|
  | Bug Hunter | Correctness — forgotten call sites, unhappy paths, wrong/non-exhaustive logic, contract mismatches, concurrency bugs — plus a dedicated error-handling lens: swallowed exceptions, unjustified fallbacks, overly broad catches |
  | Code-Quality Reviewer | Code smells, dead/unused code, duplication, SOLID/naming/PR-scope, platform checklist backstop |
  | Deprecation Scanner | APIs deprecated/superseded/removed as of 2026 (Android 16/17 — API 36/37, Swift 6, iOS 17–26) |
  | Test Analyzer | Test coverage gaps and tests that don't exercise what they claim to |
  | Comment Analyzer | Comment/doc accuracy, stranded artifacts from incomplete deletions |
  | Type-Design Analyzer | Type encapsulation and invariant expression (Kotlin sealed classes/data classes, Swift structs/enums/protocols) |

Every pass draws on a platform-API checklist matching the diff — resolved from whichever platform skill you have installed (see "Depends on" below), or fetched from its source repo for the run if it isn't installed yet — plus one bundled, cross-cutting checklist (`engineering-excellence.md`, ships with this skill) for code smells, dead code, SOLID, naming, PR hygiene, and docs, dimensions no platform repo owns.

No separate agent files — every review pass's prompt ships inline in this one skill — but fast-moving platform-API knowledge is intentionally *not* bundled here; it's delegated to the skill repos above so it stays current. For a genuinely small, low-risk diff (a typo fix, a comment-only edit), it may review directly instead of dispatching all 6 passes — same findings, less overhead.

Three cost tiers, from cheapest to most thorough: the tiny-diff shortcut above (zero dispatch, always wins when it applies), `--lite` (2 passes — Bug Hunter + Code-Quality Reviewer only, see below), and the full 6-pass dispatch (the default for anything that isn't tiny).

## Depends on

This skill carries no platform-API knowledge of its own — it's just the orchestrator, the 6 pass prompts, and one cross-cutting checklist (`engineering-excellence.md`). Platform-API checklists and deprecation tables come from whichever of these you have installed as skills; install the ones matching your stack for full coverage:

| Platform | Install from |
|---|---|
| Android/Kotlin/Compose/Gradle | [`android/skills`](https://github.com/android/skills), [`chrisbanes/skills`](https://github.com/chrisbanes/skills) |
| Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit/Xcode | [`AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill`](https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill) |
| Firebase (any platform) | [`firebase/agent-skills`](https://github.com/firebase/agent-skills) |
| Kotlin/KMP | [`Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-agent-skills) |

None of these are hard requirements — if one isn't installed for a platform your diff touches, the review fetches that repo's checklist for the run instead and tells you to install it for next time. Installing them just makes every run cheaper and faster.

## Install

Install with the [`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills), which works across coding agents — swap `claude-code` below for your agent's identifier if you use a different one:

```
npx skills add https://github.com/Abdallah-Abdelazim/mobile-pr-review-skill/tree/main/skills/review-mobile-pr --agent claude-code
```

This drops the skill into `.claude/skills/review-mobile-pr/` in the current project (or pass `--global` to install it to `~/.claude/skills/` instead, available in every project). Restart your agent (or start a new session) so it picks up the new skill.

### Use it

```
/review-mobile-pr https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/pull/<number>
/review-mobile-pr <number>                     # when already inside the repo; asks Draft-or-Live before posting
/review-mobile-pr <number> --live              # skip the question — post live immediately
/review-mobile-pr <number> --draft             # skip the question — save as a pending review (the default anyway)
/review-mobile-pr <number> --lite              # cheaper — only Bug Hunter + Code-Quality Reviewer, skips deprecation/test/comment/type-design passes
/review-mobile-pr <number> --apply-safe-fixes  # also apply narrow, safe fixes directly instead of just commenting on them
```
Flags combine — `--lite --apply-safe-fixes` works together.

Requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) authenticated against the target repo (`gh auth status`).

## Safety contract

- **Draft by default.** Unless you explicitly asked for Live — via `--live` or by answering the prompt — every comment is saved as part of a **pending** GitHub review, visible only to you until you open the PR and submit it yourself.
- **Live posts everything at once**, the moment the review finishes — still just comments, never an approval or a change request; this skill reports findings, it doesn't gate the PR.
- The skill never uses `gh pr review --comment`, `gh pr comment`, or any GitHub write API call that bypasses the single review it builds.
- If the API call fails, it prints the findings to your terminal instead of falling back to any other posting mechanism, in either mode.
- **The skill never edits your repo's files, unless you explicitly pass `--apply-safe-fixes`.** Even then, it only ever auto-applies a narrow class of unambiguous, single-line-grade fixes — anything else still becomes a review comment for you to act on yourself.
- **`--lite` is a coverage tradeoff, not free.** With it, deprecation checking, test-coverage checking, and comment/type-design review don't happen at all — only correctness, error-handling, and code-quality/hygiene do.
