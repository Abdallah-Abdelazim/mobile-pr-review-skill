# mobile-pr-review-skill (repo)

An agent skill (`review-mobile-pr`) for expert Android/iOS/KMP PR review — one skill file with all 6 review-pass prompts inlined, no separate agent files. Installed with the `skills` CLI (`npx skills add ...`); see README.md.

## Intent Layer

**Before modifying code in a subdirectory, read its CLAUDE.md first** to understand local patterns and invariants.

- **Orchestration & knowledge base**: `skills/review-mobile-pr/CLAUDE.md` - the skill itself (SKILL.md, including its inline review-pass prompts), the bundled cross-cutting checklist (`references/engineering-excellence.md`), and how it resolves platform-API checklists from external skill repos at review time

## Key Invariants

- `skills/review-mobile-pr/{SKILL.md,CLAUDE.md,references/engineering-excellence.md}` must stay in sync with the maintainer's personal global mirror at `~/.claude/skills/review-mobile-pr` (a symlink to `~/.agents/skills/review-mobile-pr`, used for local testing) — verify with `diff -rq` after any edit to this skill's files, and copy through if it drifts.
- This repo's `SKILL.md` implements an opt-in **`--lite` review mode** that narrows dispatch to just Bug Hunter + Code-Quality Reviewer (skipping Deprecation Scanner, Test Analyzer, Comment Analyzer, and Type-Design Analyzer entirely), on top of the tiny-diff exception which still takes precedence over it. It's referenced from 6 places in `SKILL.md` (the top summary table's Dispatch column, the "Review mode" section, the Usage block, step 1's header, step 3's dispatch tables + step 4's skip note, step 9's summary) — a change to this feature must be applied consistently at all 6.
- This repo's `SKILL.md` implements a **draft-or-live posting mode** (defaults to draft/pending review; live posts immediately) resolved via a `--draft`/`--live` invocation flag or a one-time prompt. It's referenced from 6 places in that file (Posting mode section, Safety contract, step 1 header, step 8's API payload, step 9's summary, the Fallback section) — a change to this feature must be applied consistently at all 6.
- `SKILL.md` also implements an opt-in **fix mode** (`--apply-safe-fixes`) that lets the orchestrator itself apply narrow, suggestion-block-grade fixes directly via `Edit`, instead of only posting comments — the only place in this skill anything ever touches the target repo's files. Every dispatched review pass stays read-only; only step 7 of `SKILL.md`'s workflow may edit, and only for a finding it re-verifies immediately beforehand.
- No review pass, and no step in `SKILL.md`, may use `gh pr review --comment`, `gh pr comment`, or the issues comments API — everything posts through the single `pulls/<number>/reviews` call in step 8, so draft and live comments always land together in one review.
- Every dispatched pass reports a `<confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW>` alongside its severity; step 5 drops LOW-confidence findings outright before cross-check. Don't remove the confidence field from a pass's output-format line without also updating step 5's filtering logic.
- Step 3 has a **tiny-diff exception**: for a genuinely small, low-risk diff, the orchestrator may review it directly instead of dispatching the full set of passes, as long as it still produces findings in the same output-format shape. This is a deliberate cost/latency shortcut, not a loophole to skip review rigor on anything with real logic.
- `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter has no `model:` field on purpose — the skill (and every pass it dispatches as a general-purpose agent) runs on whatever model the session already has selected. Don't re-pin one without a specific reason, and if you do, say why in the same commit.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't add a 7th (or remove a) review pass without also updating `SKILL.md`'s "Always dispatch" / "Dispatch conditionally" tables in steps 3 and 4, its own prompt block in the "Review passes" section, and the summary table near the top — the dispatch tables are the actual dispatch contract, not just documentation.
- **Prompt order is a cost lever, not incidental.** Every dispatched pass's prompt puts the shared PR context (intent, full diff, reference paths, output-format request) first, byte-identical across all passes, then that pass's own persona/checklist block last (see `SKILL.md` step 3 and the "Review passes" intro). This exists so the diff — the dominant token cost on a large PR — sits in a cacheable shared prefix instead of being duplicated per pass with no cache benefit. Don't flip the order back to "pass block, then context" for convenience.
- **Bug Hunter absorbs the error-handling lens** (formerly a separate Silent-Failure Hunter pass, merged 2026-09 to cut per-review dispatch count/cost on large diffs) — its prompt block runs both a correctness pass and a dedicated adversarial error-handling pass in one dispatch, with one merged severity scale. Don't split it back out into two passes without re-checking whether the cost tradeoff still favors doing so.
- **`--lite` mode's coverage gap is intentional, not a bug to patch.** Under `--lite`, nothing backstops deprecation checking or test-coverage checking — Deprecation Scanner and Test Analyzer just don't run, full stop. Don't give Code-Quality Reviewer (or Bug Hunter) an expanded, lite-mode-only scope to partially cover that gap — it was considered and rejected 2026-09: it would make a pass's own prompt block conditional on invocation flags (nothing else in this skill does that) and defeats the point of offering a cheaper mode in the first place.
- **Don't add a new platform-API check by writing it directly into one of `SKILL.md`'s inline pass blocks.** That knowledge lives upstream in the external skill repos this skill resolves against (see `skills/review-mobile-pr/CLAUDE.md`'s "Platform checklists" section) — a pass's own `SKILL.md` block should stay limited to persona, process, and whatever is genuinely unique to that pass.
- **Don't add a new cross-cutting code-quality check straight into the Code-Quality Reviewer's `SKILL.md` block either.** That's what `references/engineering-excellence.md` is for (code smells, SOLID, naming, PR hygiene, docs) — a real mistake happened once before this file existed, where the redundant-state/efficiency/leaky-abstraction checks got written inline and then duplicated when the reference file caught up. New checklist substance belongs in that file's matching H2 section (see `skills/review-mobile-pr/CLAUDE.md`'s "Patterns").
